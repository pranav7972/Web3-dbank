# Web3-dbank
Welcome to your new dbank project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with dbank, see the following documentation available online:

Quick Start
SDK Developer Tools
Motoko Programming Language Guide
Motoko Language Quick Reference
JavaScript API Reference
If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

cd dbank/
dfx help
dfx config --help
Running the project locally
If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
Once the job completes, your application will be available at http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

npm start
Which will start a server at http://localhost:8080, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

Note on frontend environment variables
If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

setNODE_ENV to production if you are using Webpack
use your own preferred method to replace process.env.NODE_ENV in the autogenerated declarations
Write your own createActor constructor
